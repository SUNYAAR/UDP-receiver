# UDP Receiver

<p align="justify"> 
This repository contains a Qt app that receives UDP packets using winpcap library. Since winpcap is a low-level library, packets can easily be received at high rates depending on the hardware used. A receiving rate of about 900 Mbits/sec was achieved with this code through LAN interface on an AMD ryzen 5 2600 six-core processor.
